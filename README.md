# Car_price-prediction
Drawing important conclusion from the data (eg. priceUSD vs Mileage or year and segment vs price): o Showing plots to show trends in data • Statistical analysis of data using p values to draw important conclusions is appreciated (eg. T-test or Chi Square Test) • Creating a model to predict the priceUSD columns.

# Propulsion Plants Decay Evaluation
Data contains compressor & turbine data from the propulsion system,we have to find the predicted columns for GT Compressor decay state coefficient & GT Turbine decay state coefficient.
# Solution Approach:
As we need to predict GT Compressor decay state coefficient & GT Turbine decay state coefficient which are continuous in nature,Linear Regression can be used for prediction
